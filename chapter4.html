    <div class="book-content center-text">

      <p>Sometimes,<br/>
      I feel unworthy of missing you,<br/>
      as if longing for you<br/>
      was a season I was never meant to live through.</p>

      <p>I still wonder...<br/>
      was the warmth you gave me real,<br/>
      or just the golden haze of autumn<br/>
      tricking me into thinking<br/>
      it was still spring?</p>

      <p>There are moments<br/>
      I want to hate you,<br/>
      for turning me into a character<br/>
      in a story I didn’t ask to be written into,<br/>
      for handing me promises<br/>
      that faded like petals<br/>
      in the quiet end of bloom.</p>

      <p>Sometimes,<br/>
      you feel like the wind,<br/>
      cold, sudden,<br/>
      sweeping through my garden<br/>
      before it even had the chance to grow.<br/>
      You didn’t just leave,<br/>
      you passed through,<br/>
      and took the light with you.</p>

      <p>But those thoughts drift like fallen leaves.<br/>
      They don’t stay long.</p>
