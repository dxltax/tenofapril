    <h2>I : <em>I Still Remember Clearly</em></h2>

        <p>
      I still remember clearly how God brought us together in the simplest way. A brief introduction, a random conversation, but somehow, every word felt comforting. The funny thing is, I was heartbroken at the time ehehe. Yet, just talking to you made me forget all the pain I had been carrying. It felt like I had found a cure‚Ä¶ and that cure was you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I still remember how your gaze always made me shy, how your smile could shift the axis of my world, how your words made me want to keep talking to you forever. Yes, you were that perfect. So if I‚Äôm this messed up over you now‚Ä¶ can you really blame me?
    </p>

    <p>
      I also remember the little things you did‚Ä¶ how your small acts of care made me feel safe and loved. How you texted me in the middle of your busy day made me feel appreciated. How your presence made me feel wanted, like I mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I liked it. I liked everything you did back when we weren‚Äôt as broken as we are now. And yes‚Ä¶ I miss it. I miss everything you once promised before you walked away.
    </p>

    <p>
      I miss you like I‚Äôm dying. Each day without you feels suffocating. Each night without you feels unbearably dark.
    </p>

    <p>
      So tell me‚Ä¶ how do I go back to the way things were, before everything fell apart?
    </p>

    <p>
      I miss you so badlyü´õ
