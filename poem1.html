    <h2>I : <em>If Reincarnation Were Real</em></h2>

    <p>
      Even if the universe gave me a thousand lives,<br>
      your name would still be the loudest prayer I whisper.<br>
      I would choose you, again and again,<br>
      even if fate writes the same or a different ending.<br><br>

      To love you, <br>
      is a choice I’ve never once regretted,<br>
      not even when the past left me aching.<br><br>

      And if I were given just one more chance<br>
      to find you in another lifetime,<br>
      I wouldn’t just love you like I did yesterday—<br>
      I would love you deeper, stronger,<br>
      until time itself forgets how to measure love.<br><br>

      I wouldn’t care<br>
      if our story ends in joy or crumbles in silence.<br>
      This feeling is one I never wish to bury.<br><br>

      Because you,<br>
      are the one soul most worthy of my love<br>
      with all of my heart,<br>
      until I run out of seconds and destinies to give.
    </p>
