    <h2>I : <em>If Reincarnation Were Real</em></h2>

        <p>
      If reincarnation were real, I know exactly what I would do with every lifetime the universe grants me. Over and over. In crowded cities or in silent corners of the world, I would search for the sound of your laughter, the weight of your gaze, the quiet way you made everything feel like home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if the universe spun me through a thousand different lives, your name would still be the loudest prayer I carry between each breath. I would choose you, again and again, regardless of the endings fate writes for us—happy, tragic, or somewhere in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because loving you has never been a mistake. Not when the nights were long and cold, not when our memories stung like salt on open wounds. Even when everything fell apart, that love remained—constant, unyielding.
    </p>

    <p>
      If given just one more chance, one more heartbeat, one more lifetime, I wouldn’t just repeat what we had. I would love you harder. Better. I’d learn your fears before they speak, hold you closer when the world turns away, and never once let doubt nest between us. I would love you so fully that even time itself would forget how to measure the depth of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it wouldn’t matter if we ended in joy or in silence. What we had, what I feel for you, was never about the ending. It was always about the truth of it, the purity of choosing someone even when it hurts.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are the one soul my love was always meant for. And I would give you everything. Every breath, every moment, every destiny, until there’s nothing left in the universe but the echo of us.
    </p>
