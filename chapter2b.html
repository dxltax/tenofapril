      <p>Everything about you<br/>
      was early spring wrapped in amber hues.<br/>
      I was healing when I met you,<br/>
      and you made me forget I was ever broken.<br/>
      But maybe I clung too tightly to that warmth.<br/>
      Maybe I drank too much of you<br/>
      like the last light before the long night,<br/>
      and overdosed on what was never mine to keep.</p>

      <div class="leaf-divider">🍂</div>

      <p>Because then,<br/>
      on the tenth of April,<br/>
      you brought autumn<br/>
      into my spring.</p>

      <div class="leaf-divider">🍂</div>

      <p>The days dimmed,<br/>
      the colors dulled,<br/>
      and I watched my joy fall around me<br/>
      like leaves letting go,<br/>
      not violently,<br/>
      but helplessly.<br/>
      Beautiful in the way endings often are.<br/>
      Painful in the way they always are.</p>

      <div class="leaf-divider">🍂</div>

      <p>And I...<br/>
      I stood there like a tree in April<br/>
      still holding on to soft green hope,<br/>
      when you arrived with wind too cold for the season,<br/>
      stripping me bare<br/>
      before I knew how to let go.</p>

      <div class="leaf-divider">🍂</div>

      <p>I didn’t ask for the poetry of loss.<br/>
      I didn’t want the beauty of falling.<br/>
      I only wanted one more day<br/>
      under the golden canopy<br/>
      we built with our hands,<br/>
      the shade of promises<br/>
      you no longer meant to keep.</p>
