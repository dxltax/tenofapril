      <p> Why does it still feel like this? <br/>
Like I’m breathing through fog…<br/>
slow, heavy, and cold? </p>

      <p> Even when I drown myself in distractions, <br/>
you rise above them all, <br/>
like fallen leaves that refuse to be swept away. <br/>
You’ve become the echo behind every noise, <br/>
the shadow behind every corner. <br/>
As if the universe has stitched your name <br/>
into every thread of my silence. </p>

      <p> And what hurts the most, <br/>
even your old praises have become wounds. <br/>
Once, they made me light. <br/>
Now, they weigh me down. </p>

      <p> I avoid the mirror, <br/>
not because I hate what I see, <br/>
but because I see you in the outline of my eyebrows, <br/>
in the shape of my eyes, <br/>
in the way my collarbones catch the light. <br/>
You used to love them. </p>

<p> Do you still? </p>

<p> Or have they lost their magic <br/>
now that they no longer belong to your gaze? </p>
