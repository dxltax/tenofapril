     <div class="book-content center-text">

      <p>I remember it all,<br/>
      the way your gaze made the color rush to my cheeks,<br/>
      like early autumn sunlight warming trees before they begin to let go.<br/>
      I remember how your smile pulled my world out of orbit,<br/>
      and how your voice made even silence feel full.</p>

      <p>I remember how we spoke until 2 AM,<br/>
      and by 4, I already missed you.<br/>
      Like the last leaf still clinging to the branch,<br/>
      I held on tightly,<br/>
      even as the wind warned me<br/>
      you were about to fall away.</p>

      <p>Your name was a season in my chest.<br/>
      Every message from you was a flicker of golden light<br/>
      dancing across the forest of my day.<br/>
      Even in chaos, I rushed to your words,<br/>
      like a child chasing leaves down a quiet path.<br/>
      You made everything feel alive.</p>
