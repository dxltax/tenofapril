    <div class="book-content center-text">

      <p> Since the day you became autumn in my life,<br/>
      I’ve been asking questions the wind won’t answer.</p>

      <p>I still wonder...<br/>
      was the warmth you gave me real,<br/>
      or just the golden haze of autumn<br/>
      tricking me into thinking<br/>
      it was still spring?</p>

      <p> Did you ever wonder how I’d fall<br/>
      I want to hate you,<br/>
      after you let go?<br/>
How quietly I’d shatter,<br/>
like brittle leaves beneath footsteps<br/>
      that never turned back?</p>

      <p> Since you left, <br/>
I’ve watched the days grow colder. <br/>
I’ve whispered into the spaces <br/>
you used to fill. <br/>
Did you ever feel even a flicker of guilt <br/>
as you drifted away <br/>
like a season that never said goodbye?</p>

      <p>Did your chest ache <br/>
when the skies turned grey, <br/>
the way mine does <br/>
every time it rains without warning?</p>

  <p> I am withering slowly, <br/>
like a tree stripped bare <br/>
long before the frost has come. <br/>
I cry in the hush of midnight <br/>
and again beneath the pale morning sun, <br/>
but you…<br/>
did you feel the same chill <br/>
settle into your bones?</p>

 <p> No... <br/>
I hope not.</p>
