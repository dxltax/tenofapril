    <div class="book-content center-text">
      <p>I still remember it clearly,<br/>
      how God brought you into my life in the simplest way.<br/>
      A brief introduction, a few lighthearted conversations,<br/>
      and somehow… you slowly became part of my days.<br/>
      Something began to grow between us,<br/>
      like tiny buds at the end of bare branches,<br/>
      as if we were two seasons quietly meeting.</p>

      <p>Ironically, I was in one of my most fragile phases back then,<br/>
      heartbroken, still aching from wounds that hadn’t healed.<br/>
      And yet, your presence felt like a warm breeze slipping through the chill.<br/>
      Soothing.<br/>
      For a while, I even forgot I was ever in pain.</p>
