    <div class="book-content center-text">

      <p> Again, <br/>
you slipped into my dreams <br/>
like an autumn wind <br/>
that won’t stop circling the same dying tree. <br/>
I miss you, <br/>
or maybe, <br/>
I’m just haunted <br/>
by the thought of your return. </p>

      <p> But whatever it is, <br/>
I’m tired of the way God still lets me remember you. <br/>
If you were never mine to begin with, <br/>
why do you still echo through my mind <br/>
like leaves that refuse to fall <br/>
even when the sky grows heavy? </p>

      <p> They say time heals. <br/>
But time, for me, has only deepened the ache. <br/>
Each morning I wake <br/>
with your shadow pressed against my ribs, <br/>
each evening I fall asleep <br/>
with the sound of your name rustling through me <br/>
like dry leaves no wind can carry away. </p>

      <p> You're the shortest season <br/>
that ever passed through my life, <br/>
and yet the longest grief <br/>
I've ever known. </p>

<p> How cruel it is, <br/>
to be left by something <br/>
so brief, <br/>
so beautiful, <br/>
so violent in its going. </p>

<p> You left <br/>
not like someone walking out the door, <br/>
but like autumn itself…<br/>
slow at first, <br/>
then all at once. </p>

<p> Now all that’s left of you <br/>
are colors fading, <br/>
air turning colder, <br/>
and a silence too loud <br/>
to be called peace. </p>
