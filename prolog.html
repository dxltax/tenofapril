      <p class="fade-in delay-2">If I hadn’t replied to your DM that day, maybe I wouldn’t have fallen this deep...</p>
      <p class="fade-in delay-3">But…<br/>If I had never met you, maybe I would’ve never known what it feels like to be truly worthy of love.</p>
      <p class="fade-in delay-4">After my last heartbreak, I was completely broken... Until I met you…</p>
      <p class="fade-in delay-5">How could that happen?<br/>How did you do it?<br/>Was I too easy to fall for you?<br/>Or were you just too perfect to ignore?</p>
      <p class="fade-in delay-6">Yes, you were that perfect...</p>
      <p class="fade-in delay-7">I still remember clearly how our random conversations made me never want to stop talking to you...</p>
