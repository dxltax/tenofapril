    <h1 class="book-title">Autumn in April</h1>
    <p class="book-subtitle">You brought autumn in my spring</p>

    <div class="book-content">
      <p>March arrived like the soft whisper of spring,<br/>
      its warmth brushing gently against the frost of my heart.<br/>
      Everything began to bloom,<br/>
      like hopes unfolding shyly beneath the tender light of a new season.</p>

      <p>But on the tenth of April,<br/>
      you came like an autumn wind<br/>
      in the middle of my still-blooming spring.<br/>
        And just like that,<br/>
      My hopes began to fall,<br/>
      quietly, gracefully,<br/>
      like leaves drifting down without a sound,<br/>
      touching the ground before I could hold them close.</p>

      <p>I never asked for the beauty of falling.<br/>
      I only wished the leaves would stay,<br/>
      clinging tightly to the branches,<br/>
      so I could rest a little longer<br/>
      beneath the shade of the promises we planted.</p>

      <p>Why did you bring autumn into my spring?<br/>
      Couldn’t you let one season last<br/>
      until I was ready to let it go?</p>

      <p>At the very least…<br/>
      let me breathe in my spring<br/>
      before it all turns into a goodbye I never asked for.</p>

      <p>And maybe, just maybe… this is where all my sorrow began.</p>
