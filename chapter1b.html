    <p>I thought you were the cure.<br/>
    A remedy for all that had broken inside me.<br/>
    But I took too much of you,<br/>
    consumed your presence like a medicine I couldn't get enough of.<br/>
    Until I overdosed.<br/>
    Like breathing in too much autumn air,<br/>
    not realizing how the cold slowly seeps into the bones.</p>

    <div class="leaf-divider">üçÇ</div>

    <p>I nearly died from the side effects.<br/>
    But still, I couldn‚Äôt stop.<br/>
    Because no matter how gently autumn strips the trees bare,<br/>
    I was enchanted by the way it happened.<br/>
    And when the time came to let you go,<br/>
    it felt like watching leaves fall one by one,<br/>
    beautiful, but heartbreaking.</p>

    <div class="leaf-divider">üçÇ</div>

    <p>So I asked myself,<br/>
    What am I supposed to do?<br/>
    If I stay with you, I die slowly.<br/>
    But if I let you go, I die anyway.<br/>
    And this season you brought into my life,<br/>
    never gave me a choice<br/>
    but to accept the loss‚Ä¶<br/>
    day by day,<br/>
    leaf by leaf.</p>
